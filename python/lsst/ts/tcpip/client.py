class Client:
    """A TCP/IP socket client.

    A thin wrapper around `asyncio.open_connection`. Like that function,
    it can only be used to connect once. Construct a new instance each
    time you wish to make a new connection.

    Parameters
    ----------
    host : `str` | `None`
        IP address.
    port : `int` | `None`
        IP port.
    log : `logging.Logger`
        Logger.
    connect_callback : callable or `None`, optional
        Asynchronous function to call when the connection state changes.
        If the other end (server) closes the connection, it may take up to
        ``monitor_connection_interval`` seconds to notice (see Notes).
        The function receives one argument: this `Client`.
    monitor_connection_interval : `float`, optional
        Interval between checking if the connection is still alive (seconds).
        Defaults to DEFAULT_MONITOR_CONNECTION_INTERVAL.
        If â‰¤ 0 then do not monitor the connection at all.
    name : `str`
        Optional name used for log messages.
    **kwargs : dict[str, Any]
        Additional keyword arguments for `asyncio.open_connection`,
        beyond host and port.

    Attributes
    ----------
    host : `str` | `None`
        IP address; the ``host`` constructor argument.
    port : `int` | `None`
        IP port; the ``port`` constructor argument.
    log : `logging.Logger`
        A child of the ``log`` constructor argument.
    name : `str`
        The ``name`` constructor argument.
    reader : `asyncio.StreamReader` or None
        Stream reader to read data from the server.
        This will be a stream reader (not None) if `connected` is True.
    writer : `asyncio.StreamWriter` or None
        Stream writer to write data to the server.
        This will be a stream writer (not None) if `connected` is True.
    start_task : `asyncio.Future`
        Future that is set done when the connection is made.
    done_task : `asyncio.Future`
        Future that is set done when this client is closed, at which point
        it is no longer usable.
    should_be_connected : `bool`
        True if the connection was made and close not called.
        The connection was unexpectedly lost if ``should_be_connected``
        is true and ``connected`` is false (unless you close the connection
        by calling `basic_close` or manually closing ``writer``).

    Notes
    -----
    See the User Guide for an example.

    Always wait for `start_task` after constructing an instance,
    before using the instance. This indicates the client has connected.

    Always check that `connected` is True before reading or writing.

    Can be used as an async context manager, which may be useful for unit
    tests.
