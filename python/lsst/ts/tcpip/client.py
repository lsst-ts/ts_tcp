class Client(BaseClientOrServer):
    """A TCP/IP socket client.

    A thin wrapper around `asyncio.open_connection`. Like that function,
    it can only be used to connect once. Construct a new instance each
    time you wish to make a new connection.

    Parameters
    ----------
    host : `str` | `None`
        IP address.
    port : `int` | `None`
        IP port.
    log : `logging.Logger`
        Logger.
    connect_callback : callable or `None`, optional
        Asynchronous function to call when the connection state changes.
        If the other end (server) closes the connection, it may take
        ``monitor_connection_interval`` seconds or longer to notice.
        The function receives one argument: this `Client`.
    connect_timeout : `float`, optional
        Default connection timeout (sec).
    monitor_connection_interval : `float`, optional
        Interval between checking if the connection is still alive (seconds).
        Defaults to DEFAULT_MONITOR_CONNECTION_INTERVAL.
        If â‰¤ 0 then do not monitor the connection at all.
        Monitoring is only useful if you do not regularly read from the reader
        using the read methods of this class (or copying what they do
        to detect and report hangups).
    name : `str`
        Optional name used for log messages.
    encoding : `str`
        The encoding used by `read_str` and `write_str`, `read_json`,
         and `write_json`.
    terminator : `bytes`
        The terminator used by `read_str` and `write_str`, `read_json`,
         and `write_json`.
    **kwargs : `dict` [`str`, `typing.Any`]
        Additional keyword arguments for `asyncio.open_connection`,
        beyond host and port.

    Attributes
    ----------
    host : `str` | `None`
        IP address; the ``host`` constructor argument.
    port : `int` | `None`
        IP port; the ``port`` constructor argument.
    plus...
        Attributes provided by parent class `BaseClientOrServer`.

    Raises
    ------
    `TypeError`
        If `connect_callback` is synchronous.

    Notes
    -----
    See `tests/test_example.py <https://ls.st/514>`_ for an example.

    Always wait for ``start_task`` after constructing an instance,
    before using the instance. This indicates the client has connected.

    This class provides high-level read and write methods that monitor
    the connection (to call ``connect_callback`` as needed) and reject
    any attempt to read or write if not connected. Please use them.

    This class can be used as an async context manager, which may be useful
    for unit tests.
