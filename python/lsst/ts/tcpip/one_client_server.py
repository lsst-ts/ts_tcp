class OneClientServer:
    """A TCP/IP socket server that serves a single client.

    If additional clients try to connect, they are rejected.

    Parameters
    ----------
    host : `str` or `None`
        IP address for this server; typically `LOCALHOST_IPV4` for IPV4
        or `LOCALHOST_IPV6` for IPV6. If `None` then bind to all network
        interfaces (e.g. listen on an IPv4 socket and an IPv6 socket).
        None can cause trouble with port=0;
        see ``port`` in the Attributes section for more information.
    port : `int`
        IP port for this server. If 0 then randomly pick an available port
        (or ports, if listening on multiple sockets).
        0 is strongly recommended for unit tests.
    log : `logging.Logger`
        Logger.
    connect_callback : callable or `None`, optional
        Asynchronous function to call when the connection state changes.
        If the client closes the connection it may take up to 0.1 seconds
        to notice (see Notes).
        It receives one argument: this `OneClientServer`.
        For backwards compatibility the function may be synchronous,
        but that is deprecated.
    monitor_connection_interval : `float`, optional
        Interval between checking if the connection is still alive (seconds).
        Defaults to DEFAULT_MONITOR_CONNECTION_INTERVAL.
        If â‰¤ 0 then do not monitor the connection at all.
    name : `str`, optional
        Name used for log messages, e.g. "Commands" or "Telemetry".
    **kwargs : dict[str, Any]
        Additional keyword arguments for `asyncio.start_server`,
        beyond host and port.

    Attributes
    ----------
    port : `int`
        The port on which this server is running.

        If you specify port=0 and the server is only listening on one socket,
        then the port attribute is set to the randomly chosen port.
        However, if the server is listening on more than one socket,
        the port is ambiguous (since each socket will have a different port)
        and will be left at 0; in that case you will have to examine
        server.sockets to determine the port you want.

        To make the server listen on only one socket with port=0,
        specify the host as a string instead of None. For example:

        * IP4: ``host=LOCALHOST_IPV4, port=0``
        * IP6: ``host="::", port=0``

        An alternative that allows host=None is to specify family as
        `socket.AF_INET` for IPv4, or `socket.AF_INET6` for IPv6.
    socket : `asyncio.AbstractServer` or None
        The socket server. None until start_task is done.
    reader : `asyncio.StreamReader` or None
        Stream reader to read data from the client.
        This will be a stream reader (not None) if `connected` is True.
    writer : `asyncio.StreamWriter` or None
        Stream writer to write data to the client.
        This will be a stream writer (not None) if `connected` is True.
    start_task : `asyncio.Future`
        Future that is set done when the socket server has started running
        and listening for connections.
    connected_task : `asyncio.Future`
        Future that is set done when a client connects.
        You may set replace it with a new `asyncio.Future`
        if you want to detect when another connection is made
        after the current client disconnects.
    done_task : `asyncio.Future`
        Future that is set done when this server is closed, at which point
        it is no longer usable.

    Warnings
    --------
    If you specify port=0 and host=None then it is not safe to rely on
    the `port` property to give you the port, because the server is likely
    to be listening on more than one socket, each with its own different port.
    You can inspect `server.sockets` to obtain the necessary information.

    Notes
    -----
    See the User Guide for an example.

    Always wait for `start_task` after constructing an instance,
    before using the instance. This indicates that the server
    has started listening for a connection.

    You may wait for ``connected_task`` to wait until a client connects.

    Always check that `connected` is True before reading or writing.

    Can be used as an async context manager, which may be useful for unit
    tests.
